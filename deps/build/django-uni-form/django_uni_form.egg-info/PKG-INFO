Description: 
        =====================================
        django-uni-form (Django Uni-Form)
        =====================================
        
        Django (http://djangoproject.com ) forms are easily rendered as tables,
        paragraphs, and unordered lists. However, elegantly rendered div based forms
        is something you have to do by hand. The purpose of this application is to
        provide a simple tag and/or filter that lets you quickly render forms in a div
        format.
        
        Uni-form (http://sprawsm.com/uni-form) has been selected as the base model for
        the design of the forms.
        
        This release includes:
        
        #. Adding in new method and action form helpers (functionality).
        #. Putting the error elements where they are supposed to be (bug).
