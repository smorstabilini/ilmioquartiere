Description: ==================
        django-staticfiles
        ==================
        
        This is a Django app that provides helpers for serving static files.
        
        The main website for django-staticfiles is
        `bitbucket.org/jezdez/django-staticfiles`_ where you can also file tickets.
        
        You can also install the `in-development version`_ of django-staticfiles with
        ``pip install django-staticfiles==dev`` or ``easy_install django-staticfiles==dev``.

        Helpers
        =======
        
        build_media management command
        ------------------------------
        
        The build_media script collects the media files from all installed apps and
        arranges them under the ``STATIC_ROOT`` folder::
        
            $ python manage.py build_media --all
        
        Alternatively you can pass a list of apps to the command::
        
            $ python manage.py build_media admin polls
        
        In case you have two apps with the same file name and relative path you should
        use the ``--interactive`` option of ``build_media`` which will prompt you to 
        choose which one to use. This is useful if you want to overwrite default media
        files with your custom app, for example. Remember to remove the 
        ``STATIC_ROOT`` folder before you use this option or the script will prompt 
        you for each file.
        
        Please also refer to the help of the build_media management command by running::
        
            $ python manage.py build_media --help
        
        resolve_media management command
        --------------------------------
        
        To quickly resolve the full file path of a media file on the filesystem,
        you can pass its expected URL path(s) to the ``resolve_media`` management
        command, e.g.::
        
            $ python manage.py resolve_media css/base.css
            Resolving css/polls.css:
                /home/polls.com/polls/media/css/polls.css
        
        If multiple locations are found that match the given path
        it will list all of them, sorted by its importance.
        
        Serving static files during development
        =========================================
        
        .. note:: Don't use this on production servers.
           This feature is **only intended for development**.
           Please, don't shoot yourself in the foot. Thanks.
        
        ``staticfiles`` provides the static file serving view
        ``staticfiles.views.serve`` to handle the app media, media files defined
        with the ``STATICFILES_DIRS`` setting and other media files found in the
        ``MEDIA_ROOT`` directory. Make sure your projects' urls.py contains the
        following snippet below the rest of the url configuration::
        
            from django.conf import settings
            if settings.DEBUG:
                urlpatterns += patterns('', 
                    (r'^site_media/', include('staticfiles.urls')),
                )
        
        Setting
        =======
        
        STATIC_ROOT
        -----------
        
        :Default: ``''`` (Empty string)
        
        The absolute path to the directory that holds static files like app media::
        
            STATIC_ROOT = "/home/polls.com/polls/site_media/static/"
        
        STATIC_URL
        ----------
        
        :Default: ``''`` (Empty string)
        
        URL that handles the files served from STATIC_ROOT, e.g.::
        
            STATIC_URL = '/site_media/static/'
        
        Note that this should have a trailing slash if it has a path component.
        
        Good: "http://www.example.com/static/" Bad: "http://www.example.com/static"
        
        STATICFILES_DIRS
        -----------------------
        
        :Default: ``[]``
        
        This setting defines the additional locations the ``staticfiles`` app will
        traverse when looking for media files, e.g. if you use the ``build_media``
        or ``resolve_media`` management command or use the static file serving view.
        
        It should be defined as a sequence of ``(label, path)`` tuples, e.g.::
        
            STATICFILES_DIRS = (
                ('special_polls', '/home/special.polls.com/polls/media'),
                ('polls', '/home/polls.com/polls/media'),
            )
        
        STATICFILES_PREPEND_LABEL_APPS
        -------------------------------
        
        :Default: ``('django.contrib.admin',)``
        
        A sequence of app paths that have the media files in ``<app>/media``, not in
        ``<app>/media/<app>``, e.g. ``django.contrib.admin``.
        
        STATICFILES_MEDIA_DIRNAMES
        ---------------------------
        
        :Default: ``('media',)``
        
        A sequence of directory names to be used when searching for media files in
        installed apps, e.g. if an app has its media files in ``<app>/static``
        use::
        
            STATICFILES_MEDIA_DIRNAMES = (
                'media',
                'static',
            )
        
        STATICFILES_EXCLUDED_APPS
        -------------------------
        
        :Default: ``[]``
        
        A sequence of app paths that should be ignored when searching for media
        files::
        
            STATICFILES_EXCLUDED_APPS = (
                'annoying.app',
                'old.company.app',
            )
