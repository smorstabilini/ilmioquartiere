Textile is a lightweight markup language originally developed by Dean Allen
and billed as a "humane Web text generator". Textile converts its marked-up
text input to valid, well-formed XHTML and also inserts character entity references
for apostrophes, opening and closing single and double quotation marks,
ellipses and em dashes.
