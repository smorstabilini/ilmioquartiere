Linebreaks
==========

- Filter name: ``linebreaks``
- Provided through Django 1.0+

The ``linebreaks`` filter replaces line breaks in plain text with
appropriate HTML; a single newline becomes an HTML line break (``<br />``) and
a new line followed by a blank line becomes a paragraph break (``</p>``).
