To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``easy_install`` utility available, you can
also type the following to download and install in one step::

   easy_install django-messages

Or if you're using ``pip``::

    pip install django-messages

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``messages``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.4 or later, and Django 1.0 or
later. You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and Django 
from http://www.djangoproject.com/.

Most of this install notice was bluntly stolen from James Bennett's registration
package, http://www.bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/
