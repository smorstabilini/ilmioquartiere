===============

``messages`` is a Django app which provides a user-to-user messaging system.
Django-messages enables your users to send private messages to each other. It
provides a basic set of functionality you would expect from such a system. 
Every user has an inbox, an Outbox and a Trash. Messages can be composed and
there is an easy url-based approach to preloading the compose-form with the
recipient user, which makes it extremly easy to put "send xyz a message" links
on profile pages.

Currently django-messages comes with these translations:

* de
* fr
* es_AR
* pl
* es
* pt_BR
* ru_RU
* nl
