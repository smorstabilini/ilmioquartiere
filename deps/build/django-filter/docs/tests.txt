Running the django-filter tests
===============================

In order to run the django-filter tests you must not only add
``'django_filters'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings, but also
``'django_filters.tests'``, which tells Django to setup the test models.  This
step is only necessary if you want to run the django-filter regression tests.
