How to use django-swaps
----------------------------

As the developer of a Pinax complete_project
----------------------------------------------

It's included.  You don't need to do anything.

As the developer of a Django project
-------------------------------------

Install as in the installation instructions.

Include 'swaps' in settings.py INSTALLED_APPS.

Then do
./manage.py syncdb

The templates were developed for Pinax, but should be modifiable for your project.

As an end-user
---------------

(If you are reading this, you are probably a developer.  
These instructions below are also included for real end-users in the template offers.html.)

Make an offer (of anything you are willing to give), ask for something you want to take in exchange. 
Could be books, CDs, DVDs, games, work, gear, money - anything.

Maybe somebody will propose a swap of something of theirs for your offer. 
If so, the proposed swap goes into your Proposed to you page and their Proposed by you page.

Your offer remains on the Open offers page so you may get other proposals, until you finally accept a swap. 
(Their offer is not open; it is bound to their proposal unless you accept the proposed swap, or they cancel their proposal.)

You can either accept or reject their proposal. Or you can discuss it in swap comments, and maybe get them to sweeten their offer.

If you accept the proposal, the swap goes into the Accepted swaps page of both participants. 

It is up to the participants to deliver on their promises.

(Swaps models contain a state called "fulfilled" that could be used to extend the app to cover delivery. But fulfillment code has not yet been developed.)

If you reject the proposal, the swap goes into the Dead swaps page of both participants, and both offers are returned to the Open offers page.
