 Media Handling
====================================

This document explains how Pinax handles media files across external and 
internal applications and themes.

Basic media handling
=======================

If you want to override default media files, place yours under 
`<project_name>/media/...` with the same path. For example:

Original file::

    src/pinax/media/default/pinax/images/logo.png

Your file::

    <project_name>/media/pinax/images/logo.png
    
    
Locations of media files
=========================

If you want to use Pinax' media handling with your own Django apps, please
make sure you put the media files like JavaScript, cascading stylesheets (CSS)
and images in the following directory structure::

    <app_name>/media/<app_name>/(js|img|css)
    
Doubling your `<app_name>` is required to prevent name collision of media files
while deploying.

Site specific media files goes to::

    <project_name>/media/siteExample.js
    
The special static file service view should be able to serve the media files in
development. 

.. _ref-media-build_media:

build_media management command
================================

The build_media script collects the media files from Pinax and all the
installed apps and arranges them under the
``<project_name>/site_media/static`` folder.

The command::

    <project_name>/python manage.py build_media --all

will collect the media files from Pinax and all the apps and places them in
the folder defined in the ``STATIC_ROOT`` setting.

If you have two apps with the same file and the same relative path it's advised
to use the ``--interactive`` option so the script will prompt you to choose
which one to use. This is useful in case you want to overwrite default media
files with your custom app for example. Remember to remove the site_media
folder before you use this option or the script will prompt you for each file.

Please also refer to the help of the build_media management command by running::

    <project_name>/python manage.py build_media --help

.. _ref-media-resolve_media:

resolve_media management command
================================

To quickly resolve the full file path of a media file on the filesystem,
you can pass its expected URL path(s) to the ``resolve_media`` management
command, e.g.::

    $ ./manage resolve_media pinax/css/base.css
    Resolving css/site_tabs.css:
      /Users/jtauber/virtualenvs/mysite/lib/python2.6/site-packages/Pinax-0.7beta3-py2.6.egg/pinax/media/default/pinax/css/base.css

If multiple locations are found which match the given path it will list all of
them, sorted by its importance.

.. _ref-media-devel:

Serving static files during development
=========================================

Pinax provides the static file serving view ``staticfiles.views.serve`` to
handle the app and theme media as well as other media files found in the
``MEDIA_ROOT`` directory. Make sure your projects' urls.py contains the
following snippet below the rest of the url configuration::

    from django.conf import settings
    if settings.SERVE_MEDIA:
        urlpatterns += patterns('', 
            (r'^site_media/', include('staticfiles.urls')),
        )
