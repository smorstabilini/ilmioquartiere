Building documentation
======================

To build the documentation (from root of source tree)::

    cd docs/
    bash build_docs.sh

This will create ``external/repos`` where it will checkout external
repositories. It will create symlinks in ``external/`` pointing to the docs
directories. This allows Sphinx to properly reference external documentation.

Running ``build_docs.sh`` more than once is okay. It cleans up any previous
runs.

@@@ Don't do full checkouts on each run of ``build_docs.sh``.


Building documentation on pinaxproject.com
==========================================

This section only applies to individuals wanting to build documentation on
pinaxproject.com. To build the documentation (assuming working directory is
``/home/pinax``)::

    cd docs_build/pinax-master
    git pull
    cd docs/
    bash build_docs.sh

While ``build_docs.sh`` is running the online documentation goes down. Ideally
we build in support to show a page indicating the rebuild while running.
