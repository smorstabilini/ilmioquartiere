Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Pinax is an open-source platform built on the `Django Web Framework`_.
        
        By integrating numerous reusable Django apps to take care of the things
        that many sites have in common, it lets you focus on what makes your
        site different.
        
        While our initial development was focused around a demo social
        networking site, Pinax is suitable for a wide variety of websites. We
        are working on number of editions tailored to intranets, event
        management, learning management, software project management and more.
